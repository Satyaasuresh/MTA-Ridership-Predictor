# MTA-Ridership-Predictor

  This project aims to expand upon the current literature and 
facilitate a proactive approach in fortifying the robustness of a complex transportation
system, primarily through exploring the various features of its ridership. Specifically,
the paper seeks to identify the most pertinent features of the MTA system and employ
predictive models in order to best predict ridership rates. In doing so, the model could
provide a nuanced understanding of the subway systemâ€™s functioning and offer valuable
insights for urban planning and meeting passenger demand.
  The dataset used in this paper is directly from the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (MTA) through the NYC Open Data platform. The dataset is updated daily
and provides subway ridership estimates on an hourly basis from February 2022 through
November 2023
